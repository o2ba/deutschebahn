  Welcome to deutschebahn.py's module documentation. The following is a basic
  guide on how to get started with this API(s) Wrapper.

# Getting Started

## Deutsche Bahn's APIs

Deutsche Bahn provides a collection of APIs made to the public with little barrier to entry, but unfortunately they are poorly documented, which means that in the creation of this API, I've had to try and infer as much information as I could from the information made available in English and German. Please understand that this may not be entirely accurate.

This module wraps a couple of the APIs in to one module, and tries to the best extent to make them interact with each other, but it's important to understand how the APIs are different from each other.

### Betriebsstellen API 

Betriebsstellen \(operation point, oPoint in the module\) is an API provided by DBOpenData that allows you to get basic information about every operating point



## Getting your API token

The first step that you must complete before using the module

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
